# odin-recipes

This project will apply HTML to build a simple recipe website.

By the time it's done, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

* Setting up different styles of texts (headers, paragraphs, lists)
* Setting up a Github repository for the website
* Documenting changes with succinct, thought-out Git commits
